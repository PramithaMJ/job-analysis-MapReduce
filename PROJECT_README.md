# Technical Skills Analysis using MapReduce

## Project Overview

This project implements a MapReduce job to analyze technical skills demand from job descriptions dataset. The system processes job posting data to identify and count the frequency of technical skills mentioned in job descriptions, job titles, and skills sections.

## Dataset Information

- **Source**: Job descriptions dataset (job_descriptions.csv)
- **Size**: ~1.7GB with over 100,000 records
- **Format**: CSV with multiple columns including job titles, descriptions, and skills
- **Columns Used**:
  - Column 14: Job Title
  - Column 17: Job Description
  - Column 19: Skills

## MapReduce Implementation

### 1. SkillsMapper.java

The mapper extracts technical skills from job postings by:

- Parsing CSV records while handling commas within quoted fields
- Combining job title, description, and skills text for comprehensive analysis
- Matching against a predefined list of 50+ technical skills
- Extracting individual words from skills field for additional analysis
- Emitting skill names with count of 1

**Key Features:**

- Case-insensitive matching
- Handles CSV parsing with embedded commas
- Filters out noise (words with numbers, short words)
- Comprehensive skill dictionary including programming languages, frameworks, tools, and soft skills

### 2. SkillsReducer.java

The reducer aggregates skill counts by:

- Summing up occurrences of each skill across all job postings
- Applying a threshold filter (minimum 10 occurrences) to reduce noise
- Outputting skills with their total frequency

### 3. SkillsAnalyzer.java

The driver class configures and runs the MapReduce job with:

- Optimized memory settings for large datasets
- Proper input/output path configuration
- Using the reducer as both combiner and reducer for efficiency

## How to Run

### Prerequisites

- Java 8 or higher
- Hadoop 3.4.1 installed
- Dataset file: job_descriptions.csv

### Compilation

```bash
# Compile Java files
javac -cp "$HADOOP_HOME/share/hadoop/common/*:$HADOOP_HOME/share/hadoop/common/lib/*:$HADOOP_HOME/share/hadoop/mapreduce/*:$HADOOP_HOME/share/hadoop/mapreduce/lib/*" src/*.java -d classes/

# Create JAR file
jar cf skills-analyzer.jar -C classes/ .
```

### Execution

```bash
# For distributed mode (requires running Hadoop cluster)
hadoop jar skills-analyzer.jar SkillsAnalyzer input/job_descriptions.csv output/skills_analysis

# For local mode (standalone)
java -cp "skills-analyzer.jar:$HADOOP_HOME/share/hadoop/common/*:$HADOOP_HOME/share/hadoop/common/lib/*:$HADOOP_HOME/share/hadoop/mapreduce/*:$HADOOP_HOME/share/hadoop/mapreduce/lib/*:$HADOOP_HOME/share/hadoop/yarn/*:$HADOOP_HOME/share/hadoop/yarn/lib/*:$HADOOP_HOME/share/hadoop/hdfs/*:$HADOOP_HOME/share/hadoop/hdfs/lib/*" SkillsAnalyzer input/job_descriptions_sample.csv output/skills_analysis_local
```

## Results and Analysis

### Top Technical Skills (Sample of 1000 records)

1. **communication** - 555 occurrences
2. **management** - 533 occurrences
3. **analysis** - 331 occurrences
4. **design** - 313 occurrences
5. **data** - 256 occurrences
6. **planning** - 180 occurrences
7. **development** - 155 occurrences
8. **software** - 136 occurrences
9. **problem-solving** - 125 occurrences
10. **security** - 121 occurrences

### Key Insights

- **Communication and Management skills** dominate the job market, appearing in over 50% of analyzed positions
- **Data analysis and design skills** are highly valued across different roles
- **Software development skills** show strong demand in the technology sector
- **Security awareness** is increasingly important across industries

### Performance Observations

- **Processing Speed**: Local mode processed 1000 records in under 1 second
- **Scalability**: The implementation uses combiner pattern to reduce network traffic
- **Memory Efficiency**: Configured with 2GB mapper/reducer memory for large datasets
- **Accuracy**: CSV parsing handles complex fields with embedded commas and quotes
